    <h1>Selectors while doing css</h1>

    <p>
      Css can be written using different kinds of selectors. We can use id class
      and elements for applying css .
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Element</li>
      <p>
        The element selector can be used directly by using the name of the
        element and giving the styling to it.
      </p>
      <li class="html">Class</li>
      <p>
        For using the class selector we can use class attribute in any elements
        that has multiple values and change the style of that specific
        element.The use of class will not make any changes in the html. By using
        . and class name after dot and writing the styles inside the {} braces
        we can use the class selector for doing the styling. DOt is known as a
        class selector
      </p>

      <li id="id">ID</li>
      <p>
        For using the id selector we use id attribute in any elements that we
        want to make changes.After that by using # and id name after hastag and
        writing the styles inside the {} braces we can use the id selector for
        doing the styling. Hastag(#) is known as a id selector
      </p>

      <li id="Pseudo">Pseudo </li>
      <ol>
        <li id="Pseudo2">Hover:</li>
        <p>We can use tag/selector name: hover for applying the hover effect to a particular tag/selector </p>
      </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>Color properties in css</h2>
    <p>
      While giving the colors styling in our web page we can do it by using
      different methods
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="name">Name:</li>
      <li class="hex">Hex code:</li>
      <li class="rgb">rgb:</li>
      <li class="hsl">hsl</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <p>Some of the other selectors are like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attribute</li>
      <p>
        Attribute selector is used by using the attribute of a specific element
        or tag. Its done by giving the attribute inisde of the [] braces and
        writing the styling inside of it
      </p>
      <li>Combinator Selector</li>
      <p>
        By using 2 tags like if we want to apply styling to the child tag of a
        parent tag like if we have a li tag inside of a ol tag we can used ol li
        {} and give the styling inside of the braces to apply the styling to all
        the li of the ul tag.Not only the tag we can do this to the class or id
        or any other selectors mentioned above in place of tags.
      </p>
    </ul>
